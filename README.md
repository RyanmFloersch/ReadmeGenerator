  This project makes use of fs and inquirer to write the readme file and take in user information. With fs.writeFile it creates the readme file with formatted information and with inquirer it prompts the user for their information.
  ## Tests
  I ran tests on the questions and inquirer prompts making sure the questions and user inputs matched up and that they where stored correctly. I then ran tests on the readme file created to make sure it was formatted nicely
